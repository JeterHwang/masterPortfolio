            "ICL is a program that aims to help international students get familiar with Taiwanese culture. A local student will pair with a international student and they will serve one elementary or junior high school in Taiwan. The international students share their culture in English and the local students translate the content into Chinese so that children can fully understand. In this program, not only do I learn how to cooperate with people speaking a different language or holding a completely different point of view, but also make a lot of friends during service period",
